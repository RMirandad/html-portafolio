<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello there! I'm Roger, a passionate learner and aspiring coder. Currently, I'm diving into the
  exciting world of web development, exploring the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  My journey into coding is driven by a deep curiosity and a love for problem-solving. I believe in the
  power of technology to make a positive impact on the world, and I'm thrilled to be a part of that
  journey.

  When I'm not coding, you can find me [insert a hobby or interest], [another hobby], or [something else
  you enjoy]. I'm always up for a challenge and ready to learn something new every day.
